A simple cloud server that runs on a local network, written in Go.

***How to run***

you just run the source code
*go run main.go*
or you can build the source code and run the executable
*go build main.go*
if you don't have go on your PC you can also download the executable from the releases

**How to view the website**
To access the website, all you need to do is to open your web browser and enter your private IP in the address bar.
to get your private IP just enter in the command line
Windows:
*ipconfig*
Linux:
*ifconfig*
then if you're on Windows copy the IP next to the IPv4 Address
And if you are on Linux I'm gonna assume you know what to copy
